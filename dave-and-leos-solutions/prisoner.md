Problem 3
=========

EGAL is O(n) (or n^2 ?), others are O(1).

Iterative approach is twice as quick but the order of growth is the same.
Space use is constant in the new version.

Problem 4
=========

When co-operating, does the same as E4E. Otherwise does slightly worse as it
gets conned in the first two turns by evil players. Tends towards patsy.
